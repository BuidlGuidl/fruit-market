# 🕹 Game Wallet 💎

🧪 this is forked from our event wallet and you can find initial details [here](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/event-wallet)

```bash

git clone https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/fruit-market

cd fruit-market

yarn install

```

> ⚙️ bring up the chain and deploy your contracts 

```bash

yarn chain

yarn deploy

yarn start

```

> 🖨 copy `packages/nextjs/.env.example` to the name `.env` and edit your frontend env:

> 💿 you'll need to spin up a KV (key value storage) in vercel and copy/paste in the env.local fields:


```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOY_BLOCK=0
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_URL=https://event-wallet.vercel.app
KV_URL=
KV_REST_API_URL=
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=
```


> 📱 hit the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`


> 📝  next, inspect the `targetNetwork` var in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` 

(if you are deploying locally it needs to be `chains.hardhat` or `chains.gnosis` out in prod)


> 💁‍♂️ login as with your nickname:

> 🏷 now you can use the browser to navigate to the `/checkedIn` route to drop tokens and gas to players:

⚠️ your frontend address will need to be an admin to drop tokens to players

> 📝 edit `packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.ts` and add your address to `dexPausers`

> ⚙️ redeploy the whole stack with `yarn deploy --reset`

🤔 try visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) from an incognito window or another browser to have a fresh burner to play with

(check in with a burner and drop some funds to it using your other account and the  `/checkedIn` page)

⚖️ at this point, player should be able to trade credits for resources on the dexes:

## Charts and Leaderboard

If you want to keep the charts and leaderboard updated you have to run a cron job requesting /api/admin/track-prices:

```
* * * * * /usr/bin/curl https://domain/api/admin/track-prices >> prices.log
```

Or you can set the cron job at Vercel using the /packages/nextjs/vercel.json config file.

(On localhost you can just use the browser to hit `http://localhost:3000/api/admin/track-prices` manually) 


---

## Trading Bots 

If you want prices to randomly fluctuate you need to run bots that have a bunch of liquidity and trade randomly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/fruit-market-trader

cd fruit-market-trader

yarn install
```

> 💾 you will need to copy your `fruit-market` `packages/nextjs/generated/deployedContracts.ts` into this `fruit-market-trader/deployedContracts.js`

⚠️ notice it changes from `.ts` to `.js` - you will also have to remove the `as const` from the end

(this tells your bots about the new contracts you've deployed)

☢️ Notice: any time you need to redeploy, do `yarn deploy --reset` and recopy over your `deployedContracts.js` 

> ✏️ copy the `.env.example` to `.env` file in the `fruit-market-trader` dir with the following info filled in:

```
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FROM_YOUR_LOCAL_STORAGE
GNOSIS_RPC=http://127.0.0.1:8545
GNOSIS_NETWORK_ID=31337
```

(you can get this private key from the local storage. it's called `scaffoldEth2.burnerWallet.sk`) 

⛽️ if your this address is loaded up with local funds, you should be good to run:

```bash
node batchPrep.js
```

⚙️ this is going to generate a bunch of trader accounts, send them tokens, and save the private keys up in your `.env` file:

(if anything fails here it probably means your burner is not correctly funded with credits and assets and you can debug balances using http://localhost:3000/debug)

> 🍎 now you can start a trading bot for each resource like:

```bash
node tradeDex.js Apple
```
